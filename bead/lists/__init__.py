"""List construction module for experimental list partitioning.

This module provides data models for organizing experimental items into
balanced lists for presentation to participants. It includes:

- ExperimentList: A single experimental list with items and constraints
- ListCollection: A collection of experimental lists with partitioning metadata
- List constraints: Uniqueness, balance, quantile, and size constraints

Note: This module provides data models only. List partitioning logic is
implemented in the partitioner module (Phase 18).
