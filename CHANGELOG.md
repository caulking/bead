- **Items** (`bead.items`): Experimental item construction
  - 8 task types: binary, forced-choice, categorical, cloze, free-text, ordinal-scale, magnitude, multi-select
  - ItemTemplate with chunking, timing, and parsing modes
  - Model adapters: HuggingFace (LM, MLM, NLI, SentenceTransformer), OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, TogetherAI
  - ModelOutputCache for efficient caching
